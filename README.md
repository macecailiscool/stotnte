# STOTNTE - Synthetic Terminal-based Online Network and Text Exchange


STOTNTE (Synthetic Terminal-based Online Network and Text Exchange) is a fictional BBS (Bulletin Board System) simulator that replicates the experience of a text-based, terminal-like network. It provides a nostalgic journey into the past, reminiscent of the early days of online communities.

## Features

- Basic commands like directory listing, help, clear screen, and exit.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter commands in the input prompt, simulating interactions with the BBS.
3. View the output in the terminal area, which replicates the responses and file listings.

- `help`: Display available commands and usage instructions.
- `dir`: List files and directories in the simulated file system.
- `clear`: Clear the terminal screen.
