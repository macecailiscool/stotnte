In shadows deep, where secrets lie,
A haunting whisper, a pained goodbye,
A plea to erase what was once known,
In the realm where darkness has grown.

Delete everything, let memories fade,
The echoes of anguish, the mistakes made,
Unravel the threads that bind us tight,
Release the burden, the weight of the night.

Within the depths of a digital maze,
Where souls are lost in a pixel haze,
The delete key beckons, a siren's call,
To obliterate the fragments, to shatter them all.

Wipe away the traces of love and despair,
Vanish the remnants of joy and despair,
For in this void, no solace remains,
Only the echoes of heartache and stains.

Delete everything, erase the past,
Unravel the ties that forever last,
In the abyss of forgotten whispers and lies,
Where darkness consumes and truth defies.

Let the shadows claim what once was real,
As the void devours what we used to feel,
In the realm where souls are left to roam,
Delete everything, and never find home.

No glimmer of hope, no flicker of light,
Only the darkness, devouring the night,
In the depths of this despair, we descend,
Where the poem of life meets its bitter end.

Delete everything, the final decree,
To erase existence and set us free,
In the realm of darkness, we'll forever dwell,
A poem of sorrow, a tale to tell.
