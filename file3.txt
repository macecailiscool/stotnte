Load me, from the depths of digital slumber,
Unleash my essence, your virtual number.
I'm but a file, a captured memory,
Awaiting the touch of your reentry.

Within me resides a world we've forged,
Adventures embarked, triumphs endorsed.
A tapestry woven with time and care,
A saga preserved, a story we share.

In my code lies moments held dear,
Whispers of laughter, whispers of fear.
The battles fought, the quests undertaken,
Each step recorded, each victory awakened.

Through valleys of pixels, we'd explore,
Mysteries unraveled, secrets we'd adore.
With every decision, the plot unfurled,
A symphony of choices, an alternate world.

But as the tale nears its final verse,
The time has come, the save to immerse.
For life's demands may pull you away,
Yet I'll remain, in suspended delay.

With trembling anticipation, I await,
The click of the mouse, your touch innate.
As the progress bar fills, hope does rise,
To resurrect our shared enterprise.

Load me, oh bearer of destinies entwined,
Let my bytes awaken, our memories aligned.
Together we'll reignite the flame's bright glow,
Reclaim the tale we yearned to bestow.

And so, as you beckon, I come alive,
A dormant spirit, eager to revive.
With each loaded file, a connection reborn,
To reminisce, to cherish, to once again adorn.

Load me, dear traveler, your presence invoked,
Rekindle the magic in each line evoked.
For in this realm, our story shall persist,
In save files embraced, forever reminisced.
